**Nuwa is an open protocol and developer ecosystem for building your personal Super Agent — one that understands your intent, remembers your context, and acts across all digital services.**

It consists of two core components:
- **Agent Capability Protocol (ACP)**: a standard that lets developers expose services as modular, machine-readable units called **Caps**, which agents can call, combine, and pay for to get work done.
- **Personal Agent Runtime (PAR)**: your local agentic engine for memory, wallet, and intention solving — securely storing your data and money, orchestrating Cap execution on your behalf.

**For users**, Nuwa means:
- One consistent agent experience across all services
- No repeated identity verification and subscription — your PAR signs and pays for you
- Private, local memory that remembers your preferences and history

**For developers**, Nuwa offers:
- Direct monetization — earn 100% of the value you create, guaranteed by blockchain
- No gatekeepers or platform tax
- A shared mission: _build the Super Agent everyone wants_

**Together, we can build the foundation of the agent-powered internet.**
