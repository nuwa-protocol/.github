**Nuwa is an open protocol for enabling your personal Super Agent — one that understands your intent, remembers your context, and acts across all digital services.**

It consists of two core components:
- ⚙️ **Agent Capability Protocol (ACP)**: a standard that lets developers expose services as modular, machine-readable units called **Caps**, which agents can call, combine, and pay for to get work done.
- 🛠 **Nuwa Agent Framework**: your local agentic engine for memory, wallet, and intention solving — securely storing your data and money, orchestrating Cap execution on your behalf.

👤 **For users**:
- 🔁 One consistent agent experience across all services
- 🔐 No repeated identity verification and subscription — your PAR signs and pays for you
- 🧷 Private, local memory that remembers your preferences and history

👨‍💻 **For developers**:
- 💸 Direct monetization — earn 100% of the value you create, guaranteed by blockchain
- 🚫 No gatekeepers or platform tax
- 🤝 A shared mission: _build the Super Agent everyone wants_

**🌍 Together, we can build the foundation of the agent-powered internet.**
