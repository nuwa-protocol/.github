# 🧠 Nuwa

**Unifying Services. Empowering Super Agents. Built Together.**

Nuwa is the **open protocol and runtime for building agent-accessible services** — we’re building the foundation for the Super Agent era.

Instead of creating isolated apps, expose your functionality as **Caps**: structured, discoverable, permissioned capabilities that any intelligent agent can use. Nuwa handles **intent parsing**, **orchestration**, and **wallet-based micropayments** — so you can focus on delivering value.

> **Open by design. Agent-native by default. Earn when your Cap creates value.**

## 🚀 Why Nuwa?

- **Build Once, Use Everywhere** – Write a Cap, and it's callable by any Nuwa-powered agent.
- **No Subscriptions** – Just pay-per-use. Value flows to creators automatically.
- **Open Protocol, Open Runtime** – No vendor lock-in. Nuwa is ecosystem-agnostic.
- **Agent-Centric Design** – Serve a new wave of agent-native interfaces.

## 🧩 What Are Caps?

**Caps (Capabilities)** are structured service interfaces with:

- `input` / `output` schemas
- Optional `auth` & `permission` rules
- Declarative `price` definitions
- Executable via Nuwa runtime or Cap API

Think of them as standardized, monetizable APIs designed for intelligent agents.

## 🧠 What Is the Super Agent?

A **Super Agent** is a user-controlled AI assistant that:

- Understands intent from text, voice, or image
- Uses memory and context to plan
- Orchestrates Caps to fulfill user goals
- Pays with the user’s wallet

Nuwa provides the infrastructure. You bring the Cap.

## ✨ Vision

We believe users shouldn't open apps to complete tasks — they should just express intent, and their agent handles the rest. All services should be rebuilt as **agent-callable capabilities**, accessible through a **single, intelligent interface**.

No more apps.  
No more friction.  
Just one bar → one agent → every service.

> **Nuwa is not just a protocol. It’s a movement.**
