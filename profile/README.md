# Nuwa

Nuwa is the **open protocol for building agent-accessible services**.

## What do we wanna achieve?
We want everyone to have the super agent they want.
- Users get a seamless, multi-modal agent that understands them, safely stores memory for them, and acts for them across all services — without app-hopping.
- Developers build reusable, composable “Caps” that are monetized per use, with no platform tax.
